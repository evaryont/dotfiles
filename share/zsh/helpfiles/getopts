getopts optstring name [ arg ... ]
       Checks  the args for legal options.  If the args are omitted, use the positional parameters.  A valid option argument 
       ment not beginning with a `+' or a `-', or the argument `--', ends the options.  Note that a single `-' is not conside
       string  contains  the  letters  that getopts recognizes.  If a letter is followed by a `:', that option requires an ar
       from the argument by blanks.

       Each time it is invoked, getopts places the option letter it finds in the shell parameter name, prepended with a `+' w
       of the next arg is stored in OPTIND.  The option argument, if any, is stored in OPTARG.

       The  first  option to be examined may be changed by explicitly assigning to OPTIND.  OPTIND has an initial value of 1,
       from a shell function.  OPTARG is not reset and retains its value from the most recent call to getopts.  If either of 
       it remains unset, and the index or option argument is not stored.  The option itself is still stored in name in this c

       A leading `:' in optstring causes getopts to store the letter of any invalid option in OPTARG, and to set name to `?' 
       a required argument is missing.  Otherwise, getopts sets name to `?' and prints an error message when an option is inv
       when there are no more options.
