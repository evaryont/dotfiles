       Given no arguments, and neither the -r or -f options, the selected hash table will be listed in full.

       For each name with a corresponding value, put `name' in the selected hash table, associating it with the pathname `val

       For each name with no corresponding value, attempt to add name to the hash table, checking what the appropriate value
