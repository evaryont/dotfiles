unsetopt [ {+|-}options | {+|-}o option name ] [ name ... ]
       Unset the options for the shell.  All options specified either with flags or by name are unset.  If no arguments are s
       currently  unset  are printed.  If the -m flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns (which should be quoted to
       as glob patterns), and all options with names matching these patterns are unset.
