setopt [ {+|-}options | {+|-}o option name ] [ name ... ]
       Set the options for the shell.  All options specified either with flags or by name are set.

       If no arguments are supplied, the names of all options currently set are printed.  The form is chosen so as to minimiz
       options  for  the current emulation (the default emulation being native zsh, shown as <Z> in zshoptions(1)).  Options 
       tion are shown with the prefix no only if they are off, while other options are shown without the prefix no and only  
       options changed from the default state by the user, any options activated automatically by the shell (for example, SHI
       in the list.  The format is further modified by the option KSH OPTION PRINT, however the rationale for choosing option
       remains the same in this case.

       If  the  -m  flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns (which should be quoted to protect them from filename e
       matching these patterns are set.

       Note that a bad option name does not cause execution of subsequent shell code to be aborted; this is behaviour is diff
       because set is regarded as a special builtin by the POSIX standard, but setopt is not.
