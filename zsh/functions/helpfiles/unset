unset [ -fmv ] name ...
       Each  named  parameter  is  unset.  Local parameters remain local even if unset; they appear unset within scope, but t
       when the scope ends.

       Individual elements of associative array parameters may be unset by using subscript syntax on name, which should be qu
       with noglob) to protect the subscript from filename generation.

       If the -m flag is specified the arguments are taken as patterns (should be quoted) and all parameters with matching na
       be used when unsetting associative array elements, as the subscript will be treated as part of the pattern.

       The -v flag specifies that name refers to parameters. This is the default behaviour.

       unset -f is equivalent to unfunction.
