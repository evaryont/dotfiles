ulimit [ [ -SHacdfilmnpqrstvx | -N resource [ limit ] ... ]
       Set or display resource limits of the shell and the processes started by the shell.  The value of limit can be a numbe
       of the values `unlimited', which removes the limit on the resource, or `hard', which uses the current value of the har

       By default, only soft limits are manipulated. If the -H flag is given use hard limits instead of soft limits.  If the 
       flag set both hard and soft limits.

       If no options are used, the file size limit (-f) is assumed.

       If limit is omitted the current value of the specified resources are printed.  When more than one resource value is pr
       printed before each value.

       When looping over multiple resources, the shell will abort immediately if it detects a badly formed argument.  However
       other reason it will continue trying to set the remaining limits.

       Not all the following resources are supported on all systems.  Running ulimit -a will show which are supported.

       -a     Lists all of the current resource limits.
       -b     Socket buffer size in bytes (N.B. not kilobytes)
       -c     512-byte blocks on the size of core dumps.
       -d     Kilobytes on the size of the data segment.
       -f     512-byte blocks on the size of files written.
       -i     The number of pending signals.
       -l     Kilobytes on the size of locked-in memory.
       -m     Kilobytes on the size of physical memory.
       -n     open file descriptors.
       -q     Bytes in POSIX message queues.
       -s     Kilobytes on the size of the stack.
       -t     CPU seconds to be used.
       -r     The number of simultaneous threads available to the user.
       -u     The number of processes available to the user.
       -v     Kilobytes on the size of virtual memory.  On some systems this refers to the limit called `address space'.
       -x     The number of locks on files.

       A resource may also be specified by integer in the form `-N resource', where resource corresponds to the integer defin
       system.   This may be used to set the limits for resources known to the shell which do not correspond to option letter
       ber in the output of `ulimit -a'.

       The number may alternatively be out of the range of limits compiled into the shell.  The shell will try to read or wri
       an error if this fails.
