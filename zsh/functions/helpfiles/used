printf format [ arg ... ]
       Print the arguments according to the format specification. Formatting rules are the same as used in C. The same escape
       in the format. All C conversion specifications ending in one of csdiouxXeEfgGn are handled. In addition to this, `%b' 
       escape sequences in the argument to be recognised and `%q' can be used to quote the argument in such a way that allows
       the numeric format specifiers, if the corresponding argument starts with a quote character, the numeric value of the f
       number to print otherwise the argument is evaluated as an arithmetic expression. See the section `Arithmetic Evaluatio
       arithmetic expressions. With `%n', the corresponding argument is taken as an identifier which is created as an integer

       Normally, conversion specifications are applied to each argument in order but they can explicitly specify the nth argu
       by  `%n$'  and  `*' by `*n$'.  It is recommended that you do not mix references of this explicit style with the normal
       styles may be subject to future change.

       If arguments remain unused after formatting, the format string is reused until all arguments have been consumed. With 
       pressed  by  using the -r option. If more arguments are required by the format than have been specified, the behaviour
       been specified as the argument.
