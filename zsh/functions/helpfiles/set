       Set  the options for the shell and/or set the positional parameters, or declare and set an array.  If the -s option is

       If the -A flag is specified, name is set to an array containing the given args; if no name is specified, all arrays ar

       The behaviour of arguments after -A name or +A name depends on whether the option KSH ARRAYS is set.  If it is not set
